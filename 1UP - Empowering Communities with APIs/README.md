# 1UP: Empowering Communities with APIs

## Presented at API: World — San Jose, CA • October 9, 2019

Good APIs can level-up the dev life, but great APIs can bring an "Extra Life" to kids in need. In this talk, we discuss building a JavaScript API that can be used in 3 different ways from the same source code with the goal of making it easier to help raise money for sick kids in our communities via the Extra Life fundraiser.
